# LSTM
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict COVID-19 confirmed cases using time series forecasting.
**The Model uses**
  - Two-layer LSTM with 100 units.
  - Fully connected dense layers.
  - Loss function: `mean_absolute_error`.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Predictions vs actual cases plotted.
  - Performance measured using MAE.

The model successfully captures trends in COVID-19 case growth, achieving a *low MAE*.
